# CodingChallenge
A collection of coding challenges in various forms including some mathematical challenges.

> ## ReverseInt
> Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1], then return 0.
> ### Solution:
> Passed leetcode tests, but not 100% sure the solution will actually allow an integer to equal the INT32_MAX or INT32_MIN values.
> ### To-Do:
> Design some unit tests to thoroughly examine if the code is functioning as intended.

> ## RomanToInt
> Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
> 
> ### Solution:
> Correctly creates an integer from a roman numeral.
> 
> ### To-Do:
> Create unit tests to verify functionality.

> ## Two-Sum
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 
> You can return the answer in any order.
> 
> ### Solution:
> 
> ### To-Do:
> Create unit tests.
