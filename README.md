# CodingChallenge
A collection of coding challenges in various forms including some mathematical challenges.

## ReverseInt
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1], then return 0.
### Solution:
Passed leetcode tests, but not 100% sure the solution will actually allow an integer to equal the INT32_MAX or INT32_MIN values.
### To-Do:
I should probably design some unit tests to thoroughly examine if the code is functioning as intended.
